### Course Overview:
The purpose of this course is to give the student a survey of both classical and modern research on international trade.  The overarching goal is to help to prepare the student to write doctoral-level research papers in trade and/or to develop techniques that will allow the student to write similar quality papers in other economic fields.  The first part of the course will review “classic” papers in international trade.  As the course progresses, the emphasis will move towards more recent papers.  The student will then finish the semester by presenting contemporary papers on international trade.

### Books:

There will be no textbook for this course.  All papers discussed herein should be available via online repositories to which the University of South Carolina has access.  However, I strongly recommend that a student who wishes to do further research in trade acquire the following books:
- Robert Feenstra and Alan Taylor, 2017, *International Trade*, 4th ed., Macmillan Publishers.  This is the textbook that I build my 500-level undergraduate course around.  It is currently in its 4th edition, though the 5th edition will probably be released shortly.  This is a good reference if you have never (or have not in a long time) taken an undergraduate course in trade.
- Robert Feenstra, 2016, *Advanced International Trade*, 2nd ed., Princeton University Press.  This is the “graduate” version of the undergrad text.  Back when the focus of this course was more on passing a field exam, I used this book as a textbook for it.  While I think that the current focus of preparing you to write papers lends itself more to directly reading papers, this book is still helpful in presenting many of the models that we discuss here in a systematic way.
- Avinash Dixit and Victor Norman, 1980, *Theory of International Trade*, Cambridge University Press.  This book presents a good summary of the state of international trade theory as of 1980, right about the time when the dominant focus of trade was about to shift to...
- Elhanan Helpman and Paul Krugman, 1985, *Market Structure and Foreign Trade*, MIT Press.  In the 1980s and 90s, a large focus of trade research was on how market structure, increasing returns, and imperfect competition affected international trade.  These two authors were at the forefront of that movement, and this book provides a compendium of their foundational models.
- Gita Gopinath, Elhanan Helpman, and Kenneth Rogoff, 2014, *Handbook of International Economics*, vol. 4, North-Holland Press.  This is the latest International Economics volume from the popular “Handbooks in Economics” series.  Each chapter provides a detailed literature review from current research programs in International Economics.  The 2nd half of the book is mainly macro-oriented, but the first half gives a very good overview of the state of the literature in international trade at the time of its publication.

### Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
- Achieve fluency in reading research papers in international trade.
- Generate research ideas for dissertation-quality papers in international trade.
- Present findings from classic research papers in international trade.
- Further develop the theoretical and empirical techniques learned in core economics courses.

### Course Grading:
There will be three components to your final grade in this course:
- 6 problem sets on the papers discussed in class – 36%
- A final paper – 34%
- One or more paper presentations -- 30%
